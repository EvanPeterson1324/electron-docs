# Corgi Docs

Corgi Docs is an Electron collaborative text editor, like Google Docs.  Users can login/register, create new text documents, collaborate
on documents in real time, and save those documents so the user can work on them later.

## Learning Objective

To enable real time collaboration using websockets and creating a responsive user interface.

## Built using...

* Electron
* React
* React router
* SASS styling
* MongoDB (Backend storage)
* Express server
* Passport authentication
* Draft.js (frontend rendering)
* Socket.io (for users to edit the same document simultaniously)

## Technical Challenges
    
   - User Collaboration: Getting changes made by one user to appear correctly for the other users viewing that document was frustrating.
     Draft.js configuration was off at times, applying highlighting at the wrong times, being one character behind the user thats typing
     and learning how to have editing on documents not affect other documents the user had saved were all challenges we had to overcome.
